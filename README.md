# Payanam — journeys with a little more soul

A complete planning preview for family journeys in Madurai: realistic visit durations, opening sessions, rest time, group transport budgets, saved itineraries, and disruption alternatives.

**Travel with confidence. Keep the moments that matter.**

This release uses clearly labeled illustrative hours, fares and travel times. It does not book tickets or dispatch transport. Saved journeys are stored in the current browser. Supabase setup is intentionally deferred.

The original engineering prototype remains below and in its existing modules.

# Payanam 2.0

Stochastic, multi-modal, state-wide transit routing engine for Tamil Nadu.

CP-SAT orienteering on a Ray cluster, orchestrated with Temporal Saga
compensations, grounded in Memgraph, driven by live Kafka signals, and backed
by a Redis geospatial fleet index for real-time cab dispatch.

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Solver | OR-Tools CP-SAT | Time-dependent stochastic orienteering with **disconnected service windows** |
| Compute | Ray Core | Heavy solving dispatched off the API event loop (`@ray.remote`) |
| Orchestration | Temporal.io | Long-running `ItinerarySaga` with Saga compensations and reactive signals |
| Graph | Memgraph (Bolt) | Tamil Nadu transit topology, idempotently seeded |
| Streaming | Redpanda / Kafka | Live traffic disruptions forwarded as workflow signals |
| Fleet | Redis GEO | Driver index + atomic cab locking for fallback dispatch |

### Reactive routing

A running workflow is long-lived, so a plan made at T+0 can be invalidated at
T+30s. `ItineraryWorkflow` accepts `transit_update` signals carrying a degraded
confirmation probability; when a still-pending leg falls below
`DEGRADED_THRESHOLD` (0.15) the workflow unwinds its Saga and books a
substitute â€” the same compensation path a booking failure takes, entered from a
different trigger.

Signals never mutate history: the handler only queues the update, and the main
coroutine drains it at deterministic safe points.

### Disconnected windows

South Indian temples close for the afternoon. Each `(node, window)` pair gets a
boolean literal, `OnlyEnforceIf`-guarded interval constraints, and a final
`model.AddBoolOr([...])` requiring at least one session to be satisfied.
The demo circuit splits across both sessions rather than forcing a midday visit.

### Fleet matching

Two Temporal workflows routinely reach the cab fallback simultaneously, so the
claim is an optimistic transaction: `WATCH` the driver, verify status, `MULTI`
the status flip + GEO-set move + `SET NX EX` lease, `EXEC`. A lost race is not
an error â€” the caller simply tries the next-nearest cab.

## Quick start

```bash
docker compose up -d          # memgraph, redpanda, temporal, redis, ray
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m app.graph.seed_tn   # idempotent Tamil Nadu seed
python -m app.worker &
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

## Running the full stack in isolation

Host ports are a **global resource**. If another project already owns 3000,
7687, 9092, 6379 or any other port, `docker compose up` fails with
`Bind for 0.0.0.0:3000 failed: port is already allocated`.

Every published port is parameterised with a default, so the fix is to copy
`.env.example` to `.env` and shift **only the host side**:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

For a machine where another stack owns the defaults, use the isolated profile
already documented in `.env.example`:

```dotenv
MEMGRAPH_BOLT_HOST_PORT=7690
MEMGRAPH_LAB_HOST_PORT=3001
MEMGRAPH_METRICS_HOST_PORT=9091
REDIS_HOST_PORT=6389
REDPANDA_KAFKA_HOST_PORT=9095
REDPANDA_ADMIN_HOST_PORT=9645
POSTGRES_HOST_PORT=5433
TEMPORAL_GRPC_HOST_PORT=7234
TEMPORAL_UI_HOST_PORT=8234
API_HOST_PORT=8001
RAY_GCS_HOST_PORT=6381
RAY_DASHBOARD_HOST_PORT=8266
RAY_CLIENT_HOST_PORT=10002
```

Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps          # wait until every service reports (healthy)
```

### You do NOT change any application setting

Only the **host** side of a mapping moves; the **container** port is fixed and
services inside the compose network keep using canonical ports and internal
hostnames:

| Purpose | In-network address (never changes) |
|---|---|
| Memgraph Bolt | `bolt://memgraph:7687` |
| Memgraph Lab | `http://memgraph:3000` |
| Redis | `redis://redis:6379/0` |
| Redpanda | `redpanda:9092` |
| Temporal | `temporal:7233` |
| Ray GCS | `ray://ray-head:6379` |

`docker-compose.yml` sets these, and every one is overridable by a standard
environment variable â€” `MEMGRAPH_URI`, `REDIS_URL`, `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`,
`TEMPORAL_HOST`, `RAY_ADDRESS`.

### From the host, use your shifted ports

```bash
curl -s localhost:8001/health    # API
open http://localhost:3001       # Memgraph Lab
open http://localhost:8234       # Temporal UI
open http://localhost:8266       # Ray dashboard
```

Running the app **outside** Docker against the shifted stack:

```bash
export MEMGRAPH_URI=bolt://localhost:7690
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6389/0
export TEMPORAL_HOST=localhost:7234
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Startup resilience

The API and worker usually boot *before* Memgraph, Temporal and Redis finish
initialising. Rather than crash-loop, `app/startup.py` retries the
connection-establishment step, bounded by `STARTUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS` /
`STARTUP_BACKOFF_SECONDS` (defaults 30 Ã— 2 s).

Retrying is deliberately narrow â€” only transport failures (`ConnectionError`,
`OSError`, `ServiceUnavailable`, â€¦). A `ClientError` from bad Cypher or an
`AttributeError` from a missing method is a **defect** and propagates on the
first attempt instead of being masked by retries. This mirrors the fail-closed
policy the repository layer uses.

On exhaustion the API logs loudly and reports `degraded` from `/health` rather
than crash-looping.

---

### Send a live disruption

```bash
rpk topic produce traffic_updates -b localhost:9092 <<EOF
{"workflow_id":"payanam-<id>","leg_id":"tn_vaigai_mas_mdu","p_confirm":0.0,"delay_minutes":45}
EOF
```

The workflow picks it up, unwinds, and dispatches a cab.

### Report a driver position

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/driver/location \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"driver_id":"drv-1","lon":80.2707,"lat":13.0830,"status":"AVAILABLE"}'
```

## Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -q                        # full suite
python -m pytest tests/test_fleet_matching.py -v
PAYANAM_SANDBOX=1 python -m pytest tests/test_e2e_integration.py -v
```

The suite runs with no containers: Memgraph is represented by the in-memory
repository backend, Redis by `fakeredis`, and Temporal by its dev server.

## Configuration

Every setting defaults to `localhost` and is overridable by environment
variable (see `app/config.py`). The docker-compose stack points them at the
in-network hostnames.
